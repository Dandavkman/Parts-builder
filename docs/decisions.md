## 2026-10-22: The AI writes a Part Spec, not code or meshes

The design agent outputs a JSON Part Spec built from a fixed list of features, positioned against anchors picked on the scan. Our own tested Python (CadQuery) turns it into exact geometry. This keeps AI-written code off our servers, gives exact dimensions, makes every number a slider, and lets checks read the spec directly. The trade-off is that users can only make shapes the feature list supports. Decided in the master plan.

## 2026-10-22: Launch with non-structural parts only

Brakes, suspension, steering, wheels, seat and seatbelt mounts, airbag areas, fuel system and tow points are blocked in code. Underhood-near-heat and emissions-related parts need admin review before ordering. Decided in the master plan.
